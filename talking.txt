Hello?  Anybody home?  It doesn't seem like anybody is here.  
WHO'S THERE!?
Oh.  Thank goodness!  Please help me, I am lost and I don't know how to get out of here.
Foolish human!  Do you really think that I care that you're lost you pathetic pile of poop!
Oh my, I...I...I'm sorry.  Please don't hurt me, I mean you no harm.
BWAHAHAHAHA!  Puny human!  Do you really think that you can harm ME???  
Who...who...who are you?
I am you're greatest nightmare!  You will rue the day you decided to get lost in my house!  DIE!!!
